particle size was measured using pCASP (Bloggs eet all 2004). 
 Jones etl (1998) conducted several studies in the area.

a large uncertainty in modelling BBBOA is extent to which measurement in the literature can be applied

#simulations
we simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.
